				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2></h2>
<p>When it comes to determining the age of a tire, it is easy to identify when a tire was manufactured by reading its Tire Identification Number (often referred to as the tire’s serial number). Unlike vehicle identification numbers (VINs) and the serial numbers used on many other consumer goods (which identify one specific item), Tire Identification Numbers are really batch codes that identify the week and year the tire was produced.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requires that Tire Identification Numbers be a combination of the letters DOT, followed by ten, eleven or twelve letters and/or numbers that identify the manufacturing location, tire size and manufacturer&#8217;s code, along with the week and year the tire was manufactured.</p>
<p><strong>Tires Manufactured Since 2000</strong></p>
<p>Since 2000, the week and year the tire was produced has been provided by the <strong>last four digits</strong> of the Tire Identification Number with the <strong>2 digits</strong> being used to identify the week immediately preceding the <strong>2 digits</strong> used to identify the year.</p>
<p>Example of a tire manufactured since 2000 with the current Tire Identification Number format:</p>
<div>
<table width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>In the example above:<br />
<strong>DOT U2LL LMLR 5107</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>DOT U2LL LMLR 5107</strong></td>
<td>Manufactured during the <strong>51<sup>st </sup></strong>week of the year</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>DOT U2LL LMLR 5107</strong></td>
<td>Manufactured during 20<strong>07</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>While the entire Tire Identification Number is required to be branded onto one sidewall of every tire, current regulations also require that DOT and the first digits of the Tire Identification Number must also be branded onto the opposite sidewall. Therefore, it is possible to see a Tire Identification Number that appears incomplete and requires looking at the tire’s other sidewall to find the entire Tire Identification Number</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of a partial Tire Identification Number on the one sidewall (shown above) reduces the risk of injury to the mold technician that would have to install the weekly date code on the top sidewall portion of a hot tire mold.</p>
<p><strong>Tires Manufactured Before 2000</strong></p>
<p>The Tire Identification Number for tires produced prior to 2000 was based on the assumption that tires would not be in service for ten years. While they were required to provide the same information as today’s tires, the week and year the tire was produced was contained in the <strong>last three digits. </strong>The <strong>2 digits</strong> used to identify the week a tire was manufactured immediately preceded a <strong>single digit</strong> used to identify the year.</p>
<p>Example of a tire manufactured before 2000 with the earlier Tire Identification Number format:</p>
<div>
<table width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>In the example above:<br />
<strong>DOT EJ8J DFM 408</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DOT EJ8J DFM 408</strong></td>
<td>Manufactured during the <strong>40<sup>th</sup></strong> week of the year</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DOT EJ8J DFM  408</strong></td>
<td>Manufactured during the <strong>8<sup>th</sup></strong> year of the decade</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>While the previous Tire Identification Number format identified that a tire was built in the 8th year of a decade, there was no universal identifier that confirmed which decade (tires produced in the 1990s may have a small triangle following the Tire Identification Number to identify the decade).</p>
<p>And finally, hold on to your sales receipt. Most tire manufacturer&#8217;s warranties cover their tires for four years from the date of purchase or five years from the week the tires were manufactured. So if you purchase new tires that were manufactured exactly two years ago they will be covered for a total of six years (four years from the date of purchase) as long as you have your receipt. If you lose your receipt, your tires&#8217; warranty coverage will end five years from the week the tire was produced (resulting in the tire manufacturer&#8217;s warranty coverage ending only three years from the date of purchase in this example).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most<em><strong> RV tires</strong></em> do not fail due to excessive wear but due to deterioration over a period of time. I had a spare tire on my Hitchhiker II which had never been used &#8212;yet it disintegrated while mounted to the rear of the trailer and covered, so I know it can happen!</p>
<p>Warren Hull&#8217;s EzineArticles article titled &#8220;<em><strong>RV Tire Protection</strong></em>&#8221; covers the situation rather well. That article gives some tips<a href="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tire-blow-out-page.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1046" title="tire blow out page" src="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tire-blow-out-page.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="194" /></a> on ways to retard the inevitable deterioration.</p>
<p>The bottom line to protecting yourself from the problems associated with a tire failure is simple:</p>
<p><strong>Replace the tire before it causes a problem!</strong></p>
<p>The next question, &#8220;When do I do that?&#8221; is not as simple to answer.</p>
<p>It has been said that <em><strong>RV tires</strong></em> should be replaced after about six years, regardless of the condition of the tread. My experience with my previous trailer would indicate that number is about right. Had I done so, it would have saved me a lot of inconvenience and some minor <em><strong>damage to the trailer.</strong></em></p>
<p>But last week, I had a failure of a tire which was barely five years old! And it was on the north side of the trailer, winter and summer. My personal feeling is that a tire should last six, seven, or eight years.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping that this failure was a fluke. If another one fails this year, it&#8217;s straight to the tire store for a new set!</p>
<p>Tires have a <em><strong>date code molded</strong></em> into the sidewall, so it is easy to know the age of our tires. The code is four digits, with the first two being the week of the year and the second two being the year the tire was manufactured. Example: A tire with the date code &#8220;0607&#8221; would have been made in February (sixth week of the year), 2007.<a href="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tire-blow-out-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1047" title="tire blow out 2" src="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tire-blow-out-2-300x105.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="105" /></a></p>
<p>The four-digit code went into effect in July, 2000. Prior to that, the <em><strong>date code</strong></em> was a three-digit code, with the year being represented by a single digit.</p>
<p>If your tires have a three-digit code, don&#8217;t be surprised if they fail! They&#8217;re over seven years old and definitely will not last forever.</p>
