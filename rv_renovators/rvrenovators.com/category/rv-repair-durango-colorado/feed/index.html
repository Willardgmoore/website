for it&#8217;s next adventure. However towards the end of your last trip you started<br />
to notice some things that you thought needed attention.</p>
<p>The first<br />
question you have to ask yourself is whether or not you should even attempt some<br />
of the maintenance items yourself. Are you ready, or qualified, for do it<br />
yourself RV repairs? Unless properly trained and prepared, recreational vehicle<br />
owners should not attempt to make certain repairs or perform service on any RV,<br />
product or component. If you don&#8217;t believe me I&#8217;ll give you my father&#8217;s phone<br />
number and you can ask him how much he paid the mechanic after one of his &#8220;I can<br />
do it myself thank you very much&#8221; attempts. I was there. It turned out very<br />
badly. It got VERY dark on the side of the road that cold night in<br />
Tennessee.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Two Types of Repair</strong></em>s</p>
<p>There are<br />
basically two types of RV service; crisis repairs and preventive maintenance.<br />
Preventive maintenance can include such items as the following: checking and<br />
sealing the roof, windows, storage compartments and doors, cleaning, flushing<br />
and servicing the LP appliances, changing the oil in the generator and chassis<br />
engine and checking all fluid levels, cleaning the filters in the roof air<br />
conditioners, cleaning and treating your holding tanks, flushing and sanitizing<br />
your fresh water system, performing battery maintenance. These can be considered<br />
something you do now to prevent something worse from happening later. Call it<br />
insurance if you like. Crisis repairs (also known as Holy Cripes what now!), on<br />
the other hand, offer no options. The problem is staring you right in the face<br />
and if you want to get back on the road it has to be handled now. A few examples<br />
of crisis repairs would be an abnormally worn tire, a flat tire, or a blown<br />
engine.</p>
<p>Fortunately preventive maintenance will go a long way towards<br />
minimizing the frequency and the degree of crisis-type repairs. Routine tire<br />
inspection and careful study of inflation pressures, checking and cleaning the<br />
refrigerator components and checking the LP pressure, regular oil changes, and<br />
periodic cleaning of the air conditioner filters can all prevent the above<br />
crisis repairs from happening. Remember the old adage.. Pound Wise, Penny<br />
foolish. .</p>
<p><em><strong>Do It Yourself?</strong></em></p>
<p>Oh yeah, remember that<br />
warranty you got along with the vehicle the day you shelled out the bucks to<br />
drive it off the dealers lot? Read it carefully before you even attempt to<br />
loosen a screw. In some cases, warranties may be voided or manufacturer<br />
liability lessened if unauthorized repairs are performed Some maintenance items,<br />
though mandated by the product manufacturer, may not be covered by new or<br />
extended warranties. Rarely are maintenance items ever covered under warranty.<br />
The key is knowing when to actively participate and when to simply make an<br />
appointment at your local service facility.</p>
<p>So the warranty is run out<br />
and you are in the garage getting the tools out. There a few more considerations<br />
to ponder before you dive in.</p>
<p>Am I physically fit and mechanically adept?<br />
&#8211; Buck up and realize your limitations there laddie or lassie. Ask yourself,<br />
&#8220;Can I physically perform the steps necessary to do this?&#8221; Many items in, under,<br />
on and around motorhomes require physical dexterity. Physical limitations may<br />
prohibit some of us from performing certain maintenance items. If the subject at<br />
hand is truly over your head then it&#8217;s ok to back off and call a pro. You<br />
definitely do not want to risk converting a simple maintenance task into a<br />
costly crisis repair! It will cost substantially more to undo an error than to<br />
simply make an appointment with a service center if the subject is beyond your<br />
scope. (Again I offer my dad&#8217;s phone number to anyone who doubts<br />
this.)</p>
<p>Do you have a willingness to learn &#8211; If you truly want to be able<br />
to perform some routine maintenance items, be willing to do a little homework.<br />
Servicing LP related appliances and components, for instance, virtually mandates<br />
a basic understanding of the sequence of operation of that appliance. Both<br />
electrically and with the flow of the LP gas. Each appliance is different, but<br />
your advantage is that you only need to learn those that pertain to your RV. And<br />
it&#8217;s not that difficult to learn. Oh, it requires reading and studying the<br />
literature that came with your rv, but for the most part, it can be<br />
enjoyable.</p>
<p>Have the right tools &#8211; Be aware that many maintenance tasks<br />
require a selection of tools and that some require specialty tools that you may<br />
not have in your tool kit. Here are a few specialty tools you may want to<br />
eventually acquire:</p>
<p>Manometer &#8211; this device allows you to measure the LP<br />
pressure correctly.</p>
<p>Never adjust your LP regulator without using a<br />
manometer.</p>
<p>Thermocouple tester &#8211; used to bench test LP appliance<br />
thermocouples</p>
<p>Battery hydrometer &#8211; one that is temperature compensated is<br />
more accurate.</p>
<p>Volt, Ohm, multi-meter (VOM) &#8211; a digital one is best, but<br />
any is better than just a simple test lamp</p>
<p>Consider the time factor &#8211;<br />
Always plan your approach to any maintenance task appropriately. Realize that<br />
all maintenance requires time. Be sure to allot yourself plenty of time to<br />
complete whatever it is you are undertaking. Do not rush yourself. You are more<br />
likely to omit a step or make a mistake if you are under pressure to complete a<br />
task when in a hurry. Remember, the next time you perform that same task, the<br />
time element will be reduced. Familiarity and repetition will breed<br />
speed.</p>
<p><em><strong>How to &#8220;Do It Yourself&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>The following<br />
suggestions will get you started.</p>
<p>Prepare a proper and clean work area &#8211;<br />
Having a clean work area for whatever the task may be is vital in order to avoid<br />
confusion and also help keep the coach clean if you must traipse in and out of<br />
it several times. When servicing the appliances for example, it is best to<br />
perform the maintenance tasks with the appliances left in the installed<br />
positions. An exception would be the RV furnace. In some instances concerning<br />
the furnace, better results are attained if the furnace is removed and the work<br />
performed on a bench.</p>
<p>If you will be needing electricity, have your<br />
extension cord uncoiled and strategically placed prior to starting. Likewise, if<br />
using a drill motor, have the correct size drill bit, or screwdriver tip at<br />
hand. Proper preparation will make any maintenance task easier. Did you remember<br />
to allow enough time to do the work?</p>
<p>Have all replacement parts ready to<br />
go &#8211; Have all replacement parts prepared and laid out for easy access. If your<br />
maintenance task involves threaded fittings, a handy tip is to apply the correct<br />
sealant or Teflon tape before actually starting the work. It&#8217;s much neater and<br />
easier when your hands are relatively clean. Lay the fittings aside and cover<br />
them with a shop towel or cloth until needed. If the new parts need any type of<br />
pre-assembly, do it now, before you get engrossed in the task at hand. If some<br />
parts in a repair kit will not be needed, separate and discard them prior to<br />
beginning. This will simplify your repair and avoid any confusion you may<br />
encounter later when you realize you have a few parts left over.</p>
<p>Obtain<br />
the necessary support materials &#8211; As mentioned earlier, have all wiring<br />
diagrams, service notes, installation instructions or any other type of resource<br />
open and within easy reach before starting the job. If you feel you may need<br />
additional help or support information, postpone the maintenance until all the<br />
necessary information is in your hand. Remember, preparation is much easier for<br />
a preventive maintenance procedure as opposed to an unwanted crisis repair.<br />
Also, keep in mind many maintenance tasks are now available on detailed<br />
instructional video tapes. Check out our Video Library Page. Additionally, many<br />
local community colleges now offer classes for the RVer and RV shows offer<br />
seminars on RV maintenance.</p>
<p>Get to know a local service facility &#8211; Do Not<br />
Leave This Step Out! Even though you may want to perform some maintenance<br />
yourself, always get to know a local dealer or service center in your area.<br />
Eventually your going to have to swallow your pride and call on them for help<br />
and aside from being there to order parts for you, they can also be a good<br />
source of information.</p>
<p>Additional tips &#8211; Never attempt to adjust your RV<br />
generator yourself. This is one area that is definitely better left to your<br />
service shop. Many specialty tools are required, as the generator needs to be<br />
load tested while making governor and carburetor adjustments. Load banks and<br />
specialty testers are beyond the scope of the do-it-yourselfer. Just remember<br />
that on the RV generator every mechanical adjustment that is made has an<br />
electrical result. You cannot tune a generator by ear. This item is for the<br />
professional.</p>
<p>Also never attempt to adjust your LP regulator without the<br />
knowledge and use of a water column manometer. Changes in the delivery pressure,<br />
though crucial to each appliance cannot be determined by visually watching a<br />
burner flame. Too high LP pressure will damage many appliances, while too low of<br />
a delivery pressure will result in improper combustion and inefficient appliance<br />
operation.</p>
<p>By honestly accessing your technical expertise, learning and<br />
gathering a resource library of sorts for those items on your coach, and<br />
acquiring the proper tools and parts, you may be just ready to experience the<br />
fun of maintaining your investment for your leisure over the road enjoyment. It<br />
is hoped that major repair costs are avoided and total enjoyment is realized<br />
from the experiences of working on your own motorhome.</p>
