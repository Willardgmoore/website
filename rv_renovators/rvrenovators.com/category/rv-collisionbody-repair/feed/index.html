				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rv-delamination-repair.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1288" title="rv delamination repair" src="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rv-delamination-repair.jpg" alt="rv delamination repair" width="256" height="192" /></a><span style="color: #000000;">About 20 years ago, a new method of RV construction came on the market: smooth fiberglass exterior walls constructed by sandwiching <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.crossroadsrv.com/line/c_construction.asp" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">an outer skin</span></a> of smooth fiberglass with the frame structure and Styrofoam or fiberglass insulation in the middle and the interior wall paneling on the interior.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">With adhesive between the different layers, it was intended to create a bonded single unit wall panel that greatly decreased the labor involved with building an RV.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">An additional benefit was the fact that the new sidewalls had better aerodynamics. Plus, the new smooth look improved the sale of RVs from trailers to motorhomes.</span></p>
<div style="float: left; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0;"></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As with many new methods it all looked real good in the beginning.  But soon, a few bugs came to the surface.  After a few years, some of the early models started having problems with the ply’s or layers of the wall structure starting to come apart (or delaminate).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">What To Look For</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first evidence of a delamination problem is bubbles (or blisters) forming on the sidewalls as the luan plywood under the outer fiberglass layer breaks down, allowing it to pull away from the wall structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Delamination is generally caused by moisture infiltrating the wall and destroying the integrity of the luan plywood.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Flexing in the wall structure can also lead to the adhesive failing or cracks developing.  Cracks are another similar issue that will rapidly send the value of your investment plummeting.</span></p>
<div id="pic-center" align="center"><span style="color: #000000;"><a class="vt-p" title="Delamination on an older motorhome. photo by Curtis at TheFunTimesGuide, compliments of Bullyans" href="http://rv-roadtrips.thefuntimesguide.com/images/blogs/delamination-on-motorhome-bullyans.jpg" rel="lightbox"><span style="color: #000000;"><img title="Delamination on an older motorhome. photo by Curtis at TheFunTimesGuide, compliments of Bullyans" src="http://rv-roadtrips.thefuntimesguide.com/files/323x242xdelamination-on-motorhome-bullyans-thumb-399x299-7798.jpg.pagespeed.ic.3PR_ALYtDf.jpg" alt="delamination-on-motorhome-bullyans.jpg" width="323" height="242" align="" /></span></a></span></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Speaking From Experience</span><strong><br />
</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I had a 1993 <a class="vt-p" href="http://blog.rvtraderonline.com/2009/02/winnebago-recognized-as-top-selling.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">Winnebago</span></a> motorhome that had a crack develop as I was preparing for a trip from Minnesota to Arizona one February.  The crack ran from the corner of the kitchen window at an angle down toward an access panel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">An older Class C mini-home I once owned also had cracks at both lower corners of the window in the center of the back wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Here’s the bad news.  Both delamination and cracks are very expensive and sometimes impossible to properly repair unless the complete sidewall of the unit is removed and replaced.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">How To Fix Cracks &amp; Delamination Problems<strong><br />
</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some body shops suggest that by cutting out the affected area of outer fiberglass and removing the damaged luan plywood, you can then replace the plywood with new substructure and re-glue the fiberglass panel back in place.  The finished repair will surly be visible unless<a href="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rv-delamination-repair-2.jpg"><span style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1290" title="rv delamination repair " src="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rv-delamination-repair-2.jpg" alt="rv delamination repair" width="259" height="194" /></span></a> masqueraded with a large decal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I tried <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GL19TE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rvroadtrips-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000GL19TE" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">fiberglass patches</span></a>, layering a couple strips of new fiberglass over the crack and smoothing with <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255Fauto%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dbondo%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Dautomotive&amp;tag=rvroadtrips-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">Bondo</span></a>.  Within the first day of driving, the cracks reappeared — going right through the new fiberglass.  Both attempts to make cost-effective repairs failed quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I was lucky.  Under a special warranty program, the <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.winnebagoind.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">Winnebago factory</span></a> covered the cost of my sidewall replacement for that particular RV..  The cracking situation I experienced was determined to be a design problem, and they stood behind their product.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">Buyer Beware: If You Spot Delamination Or Cracks<strong><br />
</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Over the years, I’ve seen many RVs that have delamination issues that just continue to get worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This should be a huge red flag if you’re shopping for a used RV of <em>any </em>make or model.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you detect any area where you feel the fiberglass has pulled away from the inner structure, just pass that RV by.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In some instances structural integrity of the whole RV has been compromised.  The wall skin supplies some of the strength of the entire wall.  Picture it like your house without the outer skin being attached to the studs.  The house would be weakened to the point of collapse.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The cost of replacing a sidewall would likely surpass the total value of the entire RV.  As the delamination gets worse — and it will — the value of your investment will slide downhill rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Unless you’ve managed to secure a deal good enough that you can overlook the damage, the best choice is to look at a different RV.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Resale value will be drastically reduced in the future.  Not many people will be interested in buying an RV that suffers from terminal delamination.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thank You</span></p>

<p>A recreational vehicle will sway from side to side when traveling down a road. The motion makes it difficult to control the vehicle and creates an unpleasant ride. Affixing anti-sway bars to the vehicle&#8217;s suspension system or hitch will help stabilize it and reduce the swaying motion. Passing trucks and gusts of wind will no longer cause the RV to move back and<a href="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rv-sway-bar.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1083" title="rv sway bar" src="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rv-sway-bar.jpeg" alt="" width="279" height="181" /></a> forth.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="DMINSTR_2" data-type="adTracking">Function</h2>
<div id="section-1" class="section">
<div id="section-2" class="section">
<p>Anti-sway bars use the weight of the RV to create stability. You install the bars to the vehicle&#8217;s frame and chassis. Anti-sway bars designed for a trailer&#8217;s hitch and tongue also work similarly. They help reduce the vehicle&#8217;s side-to-side motion by bracing the weight of the vehicle&#8217;s axle against the chassis. The anti-sway bars distribute the recreational vehicle&#8217;s weight evenly. The bar on each side effectively holds the vehicle when a gust of wind hits it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-3" class="section">
<h2>Turning and Passing</h2>
<div id="section-4" class="section">
<p>Wrestling the steering wheel back and forth to control the RV&#8217;s swaying will wear you out. Trying to make the recreational vehicle curve on a winding road is dangerous and presents risks of swaying. Anti-sway bars stabilize the vehicle on every curve and keep it from swaying. They give the RV more maneuverability, especially when passing other vehicles on the road. Preventing ongoing sway will help keep the recreational vehicle&#8217;s structure stable and prevent unneeded wear and tear. Continuous sway of the RV may cause the structure to become compromised and leaks to occur.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-5" class="section">
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<div id="section-6" class="section">
<p>Several varieties of anti-sway bar systems exist; the type you need depends on the size of the recreational vehicle and its use, such as fifth-wheel trailers, pull trailers or motorhomes. A dual-cam sway control system works on large, long pull trailers. The bars attach to your trailer&#8217;s swing bars and A-frame, right beside the hitch. The cams hook on either side of the trailer and help prevent sway before it begins. The cams unlock when the trailer turns to allow it to move but still <a href="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sway-bar-rv-pic.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1085" title="sway bar rv pic" src="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sway-bar-rv-pic.jpeg" alt="" width="353" height="215" /></a>prevent intense swaying. Hitches with attached anti-sway bars work on small tongue trailers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-7" class="section">
<h2>Anti-Sway Bars on Hitch</h2>
<div id="section-8" class="section">
<p>A weight distribution hitch has anti-sway bars attached to it; the bars help to stabilize the trailer. They prevent swaying by transferring the trailer&#8217;s weight to the rear of the trailer and its rear axle. If the trailer weighs more than 50 percent of the pulling vehicle&#8217;s weight, it should have a weight distribution hitch, according to eTrailer. The hitch&#8217;s anti-sway bars have a spring system that helps to distribute the weight and alleviate the swaying.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>All recreational vehicle owners know that </em><a href="http://rvrenovators.com/"><em>repairing your mobile RV</em></a><em> is simply something that you have to deal with on an ongoing basis. If you own an RV, you’re going to have to repair it soon. This is a fact. A home on wheels is bound to have problems. However, there are many misconceptions about mobile RV repair that you should know about. Review these before deciding on a dealer to service your RV.</em></p>
<p>It’s important to know that owning an RV is not only expensive but it is also time consuming and a lot of work has to go into it. However, owning an RV can be an exciting and rewarding experience if you are well aware of what daily, monthly and yearly maintenance needs to be put in to your vehicle. We’ve discovered a few misconception that people have about mobile RV repair and will discuss them here.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>1. </strong><strong>My RV is New! It Won’t Need to be Repaired for a While.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The first misconception that people have when they buy an RV is that it will not have any problems when it is new. This is simply not the case.  Recreational vehicles average about 6 months in the shop during their first year out. This is not a knock to the manufacturing company, this is simply due to the fact that it takes a while for such a large vehicle to get all the bugs worked out. Each coach is different and, based on the type of use it goes through, it will need certain fixes and upgrades, especially during the first year.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>2. </strong><strong>A Blowout Only Destroys My RV Tires</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One area in which some RV owners are misinformed is in regards to RV tires. An RV’s tires are super important for the integrity of the vehicle. A blowout in an RV can cause major problems and not just to the tire and wheel. Because of the sheer weight and size of the vehicle, when an RV tire blows it usually damages surrounding areas of the vehicle including molding around the wheel well and oftentimes water tanks and valves located near the wheel. This type of damage can get expensive quickly so it’s important to ensure you are using the right tires and that they are in good condition before venturing off in your RV</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>3. </strong><strong>RV Windshields and Car Windshields are the Same</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Another misconception involves RV windshields. The windshield on an RV is not like a normal car windshield. RV Windshields are actually engineered as part of the front end structure of the vehicle. This is not like a normal piece of glass that a car windshield resembles. If it is not done correctly, the whole vehicle will not be balanced as it should. It is important to have a seasoned specialist do the job for you.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>4. </strong><strong>Carpet is More Popular than Wood Flooring</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Some people view carpet as a luxury item in an RV. You may think that if you want comfort, you’ll go with carpet in your RV to make it feel more like a home. You may not realize that trends are shifting more towards wood floors for recreational vehicles. Wood floors are easier to clean, last longer, and give a sense of style and natural beauty to an RV. When deciding on what type of flooring will best fit your wants and needs, you should speak with a qualified professional beforehand to discuss options for your specific make and model.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>5. </strong><strong>Upgrading Your Entertainment Center Will Limit Space in Your RV</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the last misconception about RV repair involves your entertainment center. Many owners think that upgrading to a larger TV will take up more space in their RV and limit the amount of storage or living space in already tight quarters. However, in most cases, upgrading to a larger “flat screen” tv can actually save you space. Older TVs take up a ton of space. By remodeling the cabinetry around a new flat screen TV, you will have the new big screen you want with extra space for storage.</p>
<p>Who you choose to work on your RV is an important decision. You need to trust that your RV repair shop will take care of your coach in a timely and professional manner. <strong>RV Renovators</strong>, is a full service <a title="RV Repair" href="http://rvrenovators.com/collision-repair/">mobile RV repair shop</a> and <strong>RV body repair company</strong> that has over 30 years of experience in Arizona.
