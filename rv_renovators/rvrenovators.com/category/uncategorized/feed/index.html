				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2></h2>
<p>When it comes to determining the age of a tire, it is easy to identify when a tire was manufactured by reading its Tire Identification Number (often referred to as the tire’s serial number). Unlike vehicle identification numbers (VINs) and the serial numbers used on many other consumer goods (which identify one specific item), Tire Identification Numbers are really batch codes that identify the week and year the tire was produced.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requires that Tire Identification Numbers be a combination of the letters DOT, followed by ten, eleven or twelve letters and/or numbers that identify the manufacturing location, tire size and manufacturer&#8217;s code, along with the week and year the tire was manufactured.</p>
<p><strong>Tires Manufactured Since 2000</strong></p>
<p>Since 2000, the week and year the tire was produced has been provided by the <strong>last four digits</strong> of the Tire Identification Number with the <strong>2 digits</strong> being used to identify the week immediately preceding the <strong>2 digits</strong> used to identify the year.</p>
<p>Example of a tire manufactured since 2000 with the current Tire Identification Number format:</p>
<div>
<table width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>In the example above:<br />
<strong>DOT U2LL LMLR 5107</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>DOT U2LL LMLR 5107</strong></td>
<td>Manufactured during the <strong>51<sup>st </sup></strong>week of the year</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><strong>DOT U2LL LMLR 5107</strong></td>
<td>Manufactured during 20<strong>07</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>While the entire Tire Identification Number is required to be branded onto one sidewall of every tire, current regulations also require that DOT and the first digits of the Tire Identification Number must also be branded onto the opposite sidewall. Therefore, it is possible to see a Tire Identification Number that appears incomplete and requires looking at the tire’s other sidewall to find the entire Tire Identification Number</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of a partial Tire Identification Number on the one sidewall (shown above) reduces the risk of injury to the mold technician that would have to install the weekly date code on the top sidewall portion of a hot tire mold.</p>
<p><strong>Tires Manufactured Before 2000</strong></p>
<p>The Tire Identification Number for tires produced prior to 2000 was based on the assumption that tires would not be in service for ten years. While they were required to provide the same information as today’s tires, the week and year the tire was produced was contained in the <strong>last three digits. </strong>The <strong>2 digits</strong> used to identify the week a tire was manufactured immediately preceded a <strong>single digit</strong> used to identify the year.</p>
<p>Example of a tire manufactured before 2000 with the earlier Tire Identification Number format:</p>
<div>
<table width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>In the example above:<br />
<strong>DOT EJ8J DFM 408</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DOT EJ8J DFM 408</strong></td>
<td>Manufactured during the <strong>40<sup>th</sup></strong> week of the year</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DOT EJ8J DFM  408</strong></td>
<td>Manufactured during the <strong>8<sup>th</sup></strong> year of the decade</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>While the previous Tire Identification Number format identified that a tire was built in the 8th year of a decade, there was no universal identifier that confirmed which decade (tires produced in the 1990s may have a small triangle following the Tire Identification Number to identify the decade).</p>
<p>And finally, hold on to your sales receipt. Most tire manufacturer&#8217;s warranties cover their tires for four years from the date of purchase or five years from the week the tires were manufactured. So if you purchase new tires that were manufactured exactly two years ago they will be covered for a total of six years (four years from the date of purchase) as long as you have your receipt. If you lose your receipt, your tires&#8217; warranty coverage will end five years from the week the tire was produced (resulting in the tire manufacturer&#8217;s warranty coverage ending only three years from the date of purchase in this example).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Water heaters help bring the comfort and convenience of home to RVers, and all they require in return is a little care.</p>
<p>There are several types of water heaters, the most common consisting of an insulated water tank, a gas burner and/or 120-volt AC heating element, which is used to save LP-gas when the coach is connected to campground power. Atwood and Suburban are the primary suppliers of water heaters for motorhomes. In some Class A’s, the “Aqua hot” systems gives a continuous supply of hot water. No matter what type of water heater your coach is equipped with, yearly maintenance is a must.</p>
<p>Keeping them properly serviced will keep you in hot water, (in a good way). <a href="http://rvrenovators.com/contact-us/">Contact RV Renovators</a> for parts or make an appointment to make sure you stay in hot water. <strong>(480) 818-5904</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The entire staff at RV Renovators was delighted to receive the following letter from satisfied customers Kent and Marguerite Hartman. We thoroughly enjoyed the chance to work with them and appreciate the positive feedback!</p>
<blockquote><p>We recently spent four days in the company of some outstanding RV technicians while having work done at your facility and we would like to recognize their talents.</p>
<p>Electronics specialists, particularly Mr Bob Hauck, installed a new Winegard Slimline roof satellite on our motorhome. He also installed two new HD TV&#8217;s, two new Blue Ray players, Surround Sound and removed numerous old cables and replaced them with new cables. His installations were done in a very timely and efficient manner and he even spent considerable time to educate my wife and myself thoroughly on the operation of all the new equipment. He also had one of our roof skylights resealed and answered numerous questions I asked about Hydro Hot systems, hydraulic jacks and refrigerator replacement. In addition to being a very nice person, Bob is the most competent and knowledgeable electronics technician we have had to work on any of our motorhomes.</p>
<p>A lot of cabinet modification and some new construction was also required. These tasks were very nicely accomplished by Billy Davis assisted by Tony Iguardo. They had to remove the old heavy plasma screen TV&#8217;s and saw out large tubular frameworks of heavy gauge aluminum in order to remove the old TV&#8217;s. This was very difficult but they handled the tasks with competency and professionalism and even cleaned up every mess they made. They had to construct very precise mounting boards to attach the new TV&#8217;s to and determine the angle at which the new TV&#8217;s had to be placed at. They also constructed a new shelf under the bedroom TV in order to place the new Blue Ray Player and HD Receiver on. They modified the original wood trim around the TV&#8217;s to accommodate the new larger sets and allow the full screens to be seen. All of the woodwork used matching cherry wood and Billy&#8217;s skill in designing cabinet work and knowledge of wood finishes made the end products indistinguishable from the original cherry wood. These guys are really good at what they do.</p>
<p>In addition to Bob, Billy and Tony, all of the employees we met such as Kelly, Levi, Joel, Skip and others made us feel welcome and assisted us in any way they could. The friendliness of all the staff we met is heartfelt and commendable. No wonder that customers return for further work on their RV&#8217;s. Thank you for the outstanding jobs your group performed for us and please let the employees know how much we appreciated their fine work.</p>
<p>Kent and Marguerite Hartman</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting a flat tire in a normal car or truck usually isn’t that big of a setback. With a jack, a tire iron, and a little bit of elbow grease you can get your tire swapped out with a spare. If you’re wondering whether or not it is this easy to change a tire on an RV, the answer is no. In fact, with most full-size Motorhomes it is a very bad idea for the owners to try to change the tire themselves. RVs are extremely heavy and changing a tire usually requires a specialist.</p>
<p>There are also several components that are mounted in the wheel wells and when a tire goes flat there is a chance that they will be damaged. In order to ensure that all of the safety and luxury features are working correctly on your RV after a tire blowout, you need to have an RV repair shop inspect your vehicle.</p>
<p><a href="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tire-blowout.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-940" title="vacation_agco_automotive_trip_check" src="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tire-blowout-297x300.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Having an extended warranty for your RV is a great idea, as many of the components that can be damaged are very expensive to replace. With a quality warranty you will be able to rest assured that your investment is taken care of.</p>
<p>Another benefit of a warranty is that your insurance company will usually provide you with a list of preferred repair shops that you can take your vehicle to in confidence.</p>
<p>RV Renovators is an experienced RV repair shop that can help you with all of your repair and maintenance needs. We can help you to take care of the <a href="http://rvrenovators.com/collision-repair/rv-tire-repair-phoenix/">tire blow out</a> and get you back on the road as quickly as possible. Give us a call today for any and all RV repair needs <strong>(480) 818-5904</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are in need of a new windshield on your Motorhome, you need have a professional handle the installation. Unlike normal cars and trucks, the windshields on an RV are actually part of the structural support and if they aren’t installed correctly it can make operating the vehicle very unsafe.</p>
<p>While most people think that a normal auto glass installer will be able to replace your windshield,  you will actually need the help of an <a href="http://rvrenovators.com/windshield-repair/">RV windshield specialist</a> in order to do things correctly.</p>
<p><a href="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/rv-windshield-crack.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-929" title="rv windshield crack" src="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/rv-windshield-crack-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Safety is Key</strong></p>
<p>No matter what, the most important part of any road trip should always be safety. Before you head back out on the road make sure that you speak with a RV repair shop and have them replace your windshield. They can also check the other components to make sure that there wasn’t any damage caused by the stress of the broken windshield.</p>
<p>With a good RV windshield repair specialist you should be able to get back to the road in no time without having to worry about any safety issues.</p>
<p><strong>Proven Track Record</strong></p>
<p>At RV Renovators we have over 20 years experience renovating and repairing RVs. Our number one goal with any project is first and foremost safety.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People are often unsure about what to do after a RV collision and they will be unsure about where to go for <a href="http://rvrenovators.com/collision-repair/">RV fiberglass repair Phoenix</a>. There are a lot of steps to take following a collision or accident in an RV.
