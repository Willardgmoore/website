				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>All recreational vehicle owners know that </em><a href="http://rvrenovators.com/"><em>repairing your mobile RV</em></a><em> is simply something that you have to deal with on an ongoing basis. If you own an RV, you’re going to have to repair it soon. This is a fact. A home on wheels is bound to have problems. However, there are many misconceptions about mobile RV repair that you should know about. Review these before deciding on a dealer to service your RV.</em></p>
<p>It’s important to know that owning an RV is not only expensive but it is also time consuming and a lot of work has to go into it. However, owning an RV can be an exciting and rewarding experience if you are well aware of what daily, monthly and yearly maintenance needs to be put in to your vehicle. We’ve discovered a few misconception that people have about mobile RV repair and will discuss them here.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>1. </strong><strong>My RV is New! It Won’t Need to be Repaired for a While.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The first misconception that people have when they buy an RV is that it will not have any problems when it is new. This is simply not the case.  Recreational vehicles average about 6 months in the shop during their first year out. This is not a knock to the manufacturing company, this is simply due to the fact that it takes a while for such a large vehicle to get all the bugs worked out. Each coach is different and, based on the type of use it goes through, it will need certain fixes and upgrades, especially during the first year.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>2. </strong><strong>A Blowout Only Destroys My RV Tires</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One area in which some RV owners are misinformed is in regards to RV tires. An RV’s tires are super important for the integrity of the vehicle. A blowout in an RV can cause major problems and not just to the tire and wheel. Because of the sheer weight and size of the vehicle, when an RV tire blows it usually damages surrounding areas of the vehicle including molding around the wheel well and oftentimes water tanks and valves located near the wheel. This type of damage can get expensive quickly so it’s important to ensure you are using the right tires and that they are in good condition before venturing off in your RV</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>3. </strong><strong>RV Windshields and Car Windshields are the Same</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Another misconception involves RV windshields. The windshield on an RV is not like a normal car windshield. RV Windshields are actually engineered as part of the front end structure of the vehicle. This is not like a normal piece of glass that a car windshield resembles. If it is not done correctly, the whole vehicle will not be balanced as it should. It is important to have a seasoned specialist do the job for you.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>4. </strong><strong>Carpet is More Popular than Wood Flooring</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Some people view carpet as a luxury item in an RV. You may think that if you want comfort, you’ll go with carpet in your RV to make it feel more like a home. You may not realize that trends are shifting more towards wood floors for recreational vehicles. Wood floors are easier to clean, last longer, and give a sense of style and natural beauty to an RV. When deciding on what type of flooring will best fit your wants and needs, you should speak with a qualified professional beforehand to discuss options for your specific make and model.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>5. </strong><strong>Upgrading Your Entertainment Center Will Limit Space in Your RV</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the last misconception about RV repair involves your entertainment center. Many owners think that upgrading to a larger TV will take up more space in their RV and limit the amount of storage or living space in already tight quarters. However, in most cases, upgrading to a larger “flat screen” tv can actually save you space. Older TVs take up a ton of space. By remodeling the cabinetry around a new flat screen TV, you will have the new big screen you want with extra space for storage.</p>
<p>Who you choose to work on your RV is an important decision. You need to trust that your RV repair shop will take care of your coach in a timely and professional manner. <strong>RV Renovators</strong>, is a full service <a title="RV Repair" href="http://rvrenovators.com/collision-repair/">mobile RV repair shop</a> and <strong>RV body repair company</strong> that has over 30 years of experience in Arizona.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RV Flooring</p>
<p>“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”</p>
<p>With the current situation in the RV market, (manufacturers closing their doors and banking problems), it has become very important to keep your RV investment in tip top shape.  They just aren’t making them the way they used to.  Here at RV Renovators we have seen a sharp increase in the demand of up grading of flooring throughout our customer’s Recreational Vehicles.</p>
<p>There are lots of reasons for replacing the flooring in your RV:</p>
<p>1.	Flooding problems</p>
<p>2.	You don’t want to buy a new RV, just update the one you have (these are before during and after photos of a RV Floor replacement we did recently).</p>
<p>﻿﻿<a href="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/floor1.jpg"><img style="float:left;" title="floor1" src="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/floor1.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="275" /></a><a href="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/floor2.jpg"><img title="floor2" src="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/floor2.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="273" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/floor3.jpg"><img title="floor3" src="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/floor3.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="254" /></a></p>
<p>3.	Soiled and worn condition of the flooring</p>
<p>4.	You’ve changed spouses and it’s not their colors.</p>
<p>5.	You had to because there was a leak somewhere, got under your carpet or tile and the thought of mold in your RV doesn’t appeal to you.<br />
<a href="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/mold.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-205" title="mold" src="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/mold.jpg" alt="" width="487" height="329" /></a></p>
<p>Most RV owners don’t realize they may have had a water leaking problem that could result in a mold issue, until they replace their flooring.  It’s a good time to address those problems.</p>
<p>No matter what the reason is, it’s a good idea.  Treat your coach good and it will return the favor.</p>
<p><a href="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/tile.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-206" title="tile" src="http://rvrenovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/tile.jpg" alt="" width="183" height="193" /></a></p>
<p>The RV flooring products they have on the market are unbelievable.  They now have particle board that looks just like hard wood and ceramic tile (grooves and all), stronger than tile, yet lighter wood.</p>
<p>Knowing that the lighter your coach the more economical it is on gas mileage sounds more convincing than the usual “it’s dated and I don’t like the colors anymore” excuse (even though all reasons are valid and justified).</p>
